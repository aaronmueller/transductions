# Corresponds to the 'question' dataset from McCoy, Frank, and Linzen (2020).
# There are two transformation tokens, 'DECL' and 'QUEST'. Source sentences
# are declarative sentences with (1) no relative clauses, (2) relative clauses
# on the object, and (3) relative clauses on the subject. The generalization
# set is all sentences in (3) which are paired with the 'QUEST' token.
# 
# NOTE: The .pt files have been created manually and SHOULD NOT BE OVERWRITTEN
#       or generated automatically. DO NOT CHANGE THE 'overwrite' parameter.
