# Examines the effect of intervening PP phrases in parsing reflexive expressions.
# Sentences include intransitives, like
#   (1) Alice runs
# simple transitives, like
#   (2) Alice sees Bob
# and simple reflexives, like
#   (3) Alice sees herself
# Additionally, any of (1)--(3) may have an intervening PP between the
# subject and the verb, as in
#   (4) Alice near Grace sees John
# Names are coded for gender, with 13 masculine and 13 feminine names.
